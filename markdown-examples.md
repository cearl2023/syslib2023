This is a paragraph. Just add an empty line between
paragraphs to create new paragraphs.

For example, this is the second paragraph. I'm following
this paragraph with an unordered list:

- I can write in **bold** or use *italics*.
- I can add a [link to someplace](https://example.com).
- I can add `code` in a sentence with backticks.
- Next I use a blockquote to **not** quote Benjamin
  Franklin, who it is often attributed to, but to probably
  quote Xun Kuang, a [fourth century Confucian
  philosopher](https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/7-things-benjamin-franklin-never-said):

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me
> and I learn. --Not Benjamin Franklin and probably Xun
> Kuang

```
And finally, a code block starts with three backticks on
their own line, followed by the code (or any kind of
pre-formatted text), followed by three closing backticks on
a their own line.
